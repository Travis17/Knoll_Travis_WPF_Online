alert("Hi "+name+", lets see how many steps you walk in a year?");

//How many miles does a person walk a day?
var milesDay = prompt("How many miles do you walk a day?");
console.log(milesDay);

//Create a variable for steps equal a mile?
var stepsMile = 2500;

//alert for how many steps a person has taken in a day.
alert("Wowzas you walk "+stepsMile * milesDay+" Steps daily. Now lets see for the year!");
console.log(stepsMile * milesDay);

//create a variable to see how many steps a person walks in a year.
var daysYear = 365;

//calculate how many steps a person will take in a year.
alert("You will walk "+daysYear * stepsMile * milesDay+" This year! Might want to buy some new shoes.");
